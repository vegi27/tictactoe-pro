Tic-Tac-Toe Pro 🚀

A modern, neon-themed Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a "Forced Move" mechanic, local PvP, and a heuristic-based AI opponent.

🎮 How to Play

The Goal: Win three small boards in a row on the main grid.

Forced Play: If you play in the top-right square of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-right small board on their next turn.

Free Move: If you are sent to a board that is already full or won, you can play anywhere you like!
