Tic-Tac-Toe Pro 🚀

A modern, neon-themed Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a "Forced Move" mechanic, local PvP, and a heuristic-based AI opponent.

🎮 How to Play

The Goal: Win three small boards in a row on the main grid.

Forced Play: If you play in the top-right square of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-right small board on their next turn.

Free Move: If you are sent to a board that is already full or won, you can play anywhere you like!

🚀 How to Host This Website (GitHub Pages)

Since you are using GitHub, follow these exact steps to turn this code into a live website:

Step 1: Create the Repository

Log in to your GitHub Account.

Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.

Repository name: Enter a name (e.g., tictactoe-pro).

Public/Private: Make sure it is set to Public (GitHub Pages is free for public repos).

Click Create repository.

Step 2: Upload Your Files

On your new repository page, look for the link that says uploading an existing file.

Drag and drop your index.html file here.

Note: It is crucial that the file is named index.html. If it is named something else, your website link won't work automatically.

(Optional) Drag and drop this README.md file there too.

Scroll down to "Commit changes" and click the green Commit changes button.

Step 3: Activate GitHub Pages

Near the top of your repository menu, click the Settings tab (it has a gear icon ⚙️).

In the left-hand sidebar, look for the "Code and automation" section and click on Pages.

Under Build and deployment > Branch, click the dropdown that says "None".

Select main (or master) and click Save.

Step 4: Go Live!

Stay on the Pages settings screen.

Wait about 1–2 minutes. Refresh the page occasionally.

You will eventually see a bar at the top that says:

"Your site is live at https://<your-username>.github.io/tictactoe-pro/"

Click that link to play your game on any device!
